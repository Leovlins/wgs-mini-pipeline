# Mini WGS Pipeline (Reproducible)

This repository contains a minimal, reproducible Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS)
pipeline for Illumina paired-end data.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate good practices in bioinformatics
pipelines, including quality control, alignment and reproducibility.
